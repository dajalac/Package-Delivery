# Package-Delivery

The program simulates route delivery trucks in Salt Lake City, Utah. The goal is to meet all the deadlines while traveling the least number of miles. 

**Features include:**
* A greedy algorithm was implemented to find the shortest path route for all packages to be delivered on time. 
* A lookup menu that allows the user to visualize the status of all packages and also locate a package by its ID and by its delivered time.
